Extensions:

Added sounds and music to the game. The background music plays continuously from app.py. The individual sounds (the shooting sounds and the blowing up sounds) are played by the wave file whenever the requirements are met. Muting is determined by the wave file, which receives input and conveys whether to mute the background music to app.py.

The aliens speed up (by 0.97 of the current ALIEN_SPEED) as each aliens die. Therefore the game gets harder the more aliens there are to kill.

Controls:
Arrow keys to move.
Z to shoot.
M to mute the sounds.

WARNING:
Game took a while to load when I first ran it, but it ran smoothly after that bumpy start.
