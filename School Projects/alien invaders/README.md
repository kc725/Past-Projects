A version of the classic 2D arcade game "Alien Invaders". The goal of the game is to shoot down the "aliens" before they
kill you or reach the bottom of the screen. Our job for the project was to write the controller for the game objects. The actual
game models were provided. More information can be found at https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2017fa/assignments/assignment7/index.php

<p>Issues</p>
