# Blight
>This was done for the CS 3110 Spring 2019 midterm project. There were 3 other contributers, Jason Pan, Jeremy Wang, and Eli Zhang. The entire project was written in OCaml.

## Description
Blight is a game where players can choose a disease and place it on a randomly generated map to watch it spread. As the disease is spreading in real time, the player can pause the game at any time to customize and upgrade their disease. The ultimate goal of the game is to infect and kill the entire population of the map.
