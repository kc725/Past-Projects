# Stock Alert 
This project was done for the Cornell Appdev Hack Challenge Spring 2019. It was done in collaboration with Annamalai Annamalai, Lily Englert, and Zhengxun Wu. [The original project link can be found here.](https://github.com/Lilyenglert/Stock-Alert-Hack-Challenge)

Only the Backend portion is linked because that is what I primarily worked on along with Zhengxun Wu. 

Also the winners of the Hack Challenge Best Backend Implementation!
